This project contains the detailed analysis of all the Summer Olympics' held between 1896 to 2012.

The analysis has been made using pandas and matplotlib (wherever required).

The summer.csv file contains all the required data (namely: 'Year' ,'City' ,'Sport' ,'Discipline' ,'Ahtlete' ,'Country' ,'Gender' ,'Event' and 'Medal'.

The Summer_Olympics.ipynb file contains the code with detailed analysis for the questions mentioned as follows.

                                                                                                                                     pandas - !pip install pandas
                                                                                                                                     matplotlib - !pip install matplotlib
